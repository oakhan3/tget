# tget

A super mini-utility to store and retrieve random snippets in your terminal!

## Install

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oakhan3/tget/master/install | python

## But why?

I found myself storing snippets of commands, code and unicode in random files, gists, or terminal reverse search, only to lose it or forget how or why I stored it there.

Some examples:

* Cryptic `sed` commands I would pipe log streams into:

      $ tg sed-nl

      | sed -i 's/\\n/\n/g'

* Unicode!

      $ tg squiggly-n

      Ã±

* Arbritary things I would google EVERYTIME otherwise

      $ tg pg-uri

      postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname

* Project specific things that don't warrant their own aliases and tend to get lost in reverse search

      $ `tg dru-log`  // This evaluates "docker-compose logs --tail 15 -f under-dg-rabbit"
      ...
      under-dg-rabbit_2  |  completed with 3 plugins.
      under-dg-rabbit_2  | 2018-03-03 14:02:01.377 [info] <0.5.0> Server startup complete; 3 plugins   started.
      under-dg-rabbit_1  |  * rabbitmq_management
      under-dg-rabbit_1  |  * rabbitmq_web_dispatch
      under-dg-rabbit_3  |  * rabbitmq_management_agent
      ...

## Notes

* Values are stored as plain-text so this is NOT a tool to store any form of sensitive data like passwords.
* You can find the stored values in a json file located at `~/.tget/store.json`
* Currently only supports Unix-like Operating Systems.
